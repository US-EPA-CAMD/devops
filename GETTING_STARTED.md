## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Set environment variables
- Establish cloud.gov SSH tunnel

**Environment Variables**

You will need to set up the following environment variables in order to access the database. These are to be used for development purposes only.

- EASEY_DB_HOST: localhost
- EASEY_DB_PORT: `LOCAL_PORT` used in the SSH tunnel

Please reach out to an EPA tech lead (see Mike Heese or Jason Whitehead) to get the values for these variables

- EASEY_DB_NAME
- EASEY_DB_PWD
- EASEY_DB_USER
 

**Cloud.gov SSH tunnel**

1. [Log in and set up the command line](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/#set-up-the-command-line) 

2. Target the development org (you will need to be granted permission to access this):
```bash
$ cf target -o epa-easey -s dev
```
3. Open SSH tunnel
```bash
$ cf ssh auth-api -L <LOCAL_PORT>:<DB_HOST>:5432
```
4. Keep the SSH tunnel open while running the application

> NOTE: For more information on cloud.gov, please refer to their [documentation](https://cloud.gov/docs/).
