## Cloud Foundry CLI
For the scripts to function properly the [Cloud Foundry cli] must be installed in order to run cf commands

## Environment Variables
On Linux or Debian systems create a bash script in the /etc/profile.d folder with the following environment variables...
```sh
export CF_USERNAME=set to cf service account id
export CF_PASSWORD=set to cf service account password
```
NOTE: On Windows systems just create system level environment variables

## Cloud Foundry Login
```sh
$ cf api https://api.fr.cloud.gov
$ cf auth
$ cf target -o $CF_ORG_NAME -s $CF_SPACE_NAME
```

## CF SSH Tunnel
This script will login to cloud.gov and establish an SSH tunnel forwarding the remote port back to the local port providing a channel to communicate to cloud.gov services such as a database service. The application specified must be bound to the service prior to establishing the connection.
```sh
$ ./cf-ssh-tunnel.sh --organization $CF_ORG_NAME --space $CF_SPACE_NAME --host $CF_DB_HOST --application $CF_APPLICATON --localPort $LOCAL_PORT --remotePort $REMOTE_PORT
```
NOTE: Replace $PARAMS with actual values or see the Environment Variables section regarding creating environment variables

#### EXAMPLE
```sh
$ ./cf-ssh-tunnel.sh --organization epa-easey --space dev --host cg-aws-broker-prodg1t1yiwikl6s1rs.ci7nkegdizyy.us-gov-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com --application facilities-api --localPort 15210 --remotePort 5432
```

## Bind Service
To bind an application to a service within cloud.gov run the following commands at a cmd prompt that is logged into cloud.gov...

#### Usage
```sh
$ cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE [-c PARAMETERS_AS_JSON] [--binding-name BINDING_NAME]
```
Optionally provide service-specific configuration parameters in a valid JSON object in-line:
```sh
$ cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c '{"name":"value","name":"value"}'
```
Optionally provide a file containing service-specific configuration parameters in a valid JSON object. The path to the parameters file can be an absolute or relative path to a file.
```sh
$ cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE -c PATH_TO_FILE
```
Example of valid JSON object: { "permissions": "read-only" } Optionally provide a binding name for the association between an app and a service instance:
```sh
$ cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE --binding-name BINDING_NAME
```

#### EXAMPLES
Linux/Mac:
```sh
$ cf bind-service myapp mydb -c '{"permissions":"read-only"}'
```
Windows Command Line:
```sh
$ cf bind-service myapp mydb -c "{\"permissions\":\"read-only\"}"
```
Windows PowerShell:
```sh
$ cf bind-service myapp mydb -c '{\"permissions\":\"read-only\"}'`
$ cf bind-service myapp mydb -c ~/workspace/tmp/instance_config.json --binding-name BINDING_NAME
```
